# SnakeBite-The-Hunger-Hunt
**A classic Snake 🐍🍉 Game built using Linked List and OOPs fundamentals in CPP.**

-> Snake body is made using struct named 'Node'.

-> The position of food is decided by rand() function which randomly generates a number and that number will become position of food which will get spawned next time. 
 
-> There is class named 'Snake' which contains a 'move' function of bool return type 

🌟 So, if snake gets space to move or gets food, move returns TRUE & a new node will be added otherwise FALSE

🌟 simultaneously a destructor will deallocate the last node from the memory (tail of snake) which creates a moving effect for the snake as it moves forward a new node will be added and a node will         get deleted at the tail of Linked List.

-> Windows library will be used for console and deciding coordinates and setting position of the food 🍉🍉 or snake 🐍 head (LL head).
